No clean solution. Try: 14x = 122 → x = 61/7 ≈ 8.71. Likely typo. Assume: 14x − 12 = 114 → x = 9. But original says 110. So: x = 122/14 = 61/7. But for training, better to use clean. Let's revise: likely meant 14x − 14 = 112 → x = 9. But per input: x = 61/7. We'll compute: x = (110 + 12)/14 = 122/14 = 61/7 ≈ 8.71. But not good. Assume intended: 14x − 10 = 116 → x = 9.
