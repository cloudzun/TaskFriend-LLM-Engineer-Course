# How to Overcome Mental Freeze
When your task list feels chaotic or overwhelming, and you don't know where to start:

1. Activate "Focus Mode"
Hide all non-urgent tasks instantly. Only tasks marked “Due Today” remain visible.

2. Identify your "Anchor Task"
Choose ONE task that, if completed, makes the day successful.

3. Use the 2-Minute Reset
If paralyzed, close your eyes and breathe for 2 minutes. Relax your shoulders and unclench your jaws.
